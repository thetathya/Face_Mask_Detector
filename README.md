# Face_Mask_Detector
The project is built using Computer Vision and Deep Learning concepts in order to detect face masks in live video streams. The model uses the MobileNetV2 architecture which is computationally efficient which allows it deploy on embedded systems easily like Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.
